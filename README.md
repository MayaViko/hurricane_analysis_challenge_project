# Hurricane Analysis

This Codecademy project that included creation of functions that should organise and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes in accordance with the assigned tasks.

The projected occurred writting and testing next functions:
    1) Function that returns a new list of updated damages where the recorded data is converted to float values and the missing data is retained as "Damages not recorded".
    2) Function that constructs a dictionary made out of the lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data about hurricanes. 
    3) Function that converts the dictionary of hurricanes to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year.
    4) Function that counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane with storing and returning the results in a dictionary where the keys are the affected areas and the values are counts of how many times the areas were affected.
    5) Function that finds the area affected by the most hurricanes, and defins how often it was hit.
    6) Function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest number of deaths, and defins how many deaths it caused.
    7) Function that rates hurricanes on a mortality scale according to the given ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of deaths for that rating,  storing the hurricanes in a new dictionary where the keys are mortality ratings and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that falls into that mortality rating.
    8) Function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest damage, and defins how costly it was.
    9) Function that rates hurricanes on a damage scale according to the given ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of damage for that rating, storing the hurricanes in a new dictionary where the keys are damage ratings and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that falls into that damage rating.
